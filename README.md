**Netflix Clone**
This is a fully responsive Netflix clone designed to demonstrate my frontend development skills. The project replicates several key design elements from the Netflix platform, including the layout, grid system, and interactive features.

Key Features:

Header section with Netflix branding, language selection, and sign-in button.
Email signup form for users to enter their email to get started with the membership.
Interactive carousel of trending content with clickable movie images that lead to separate pages (or external links).
Styled buttons for a polished user interface and experience.
Footer with links to FAQ, Help Center, and Investor Relations pages.
A fully responsive layout to ensure compatibility across various screen sizes and devices.
